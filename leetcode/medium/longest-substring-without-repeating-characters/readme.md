# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem statement:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Examples:
```py
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
```py
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
```py
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
```py
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
