# Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem statement:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the n'th node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Examples:
```py
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```
```py
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```
```py
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1 <= sz <= 30
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- 1 <= n <= sz
