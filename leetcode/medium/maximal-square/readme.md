# Maximal Square

## Problem statement:
Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

## Examples:
```py
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```
```py
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```
```py
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
